Fast, all-in-one tool for efficient and collaborative eSTAR preparation

Regby streamlines single-source authoring, file management, and navigation, so that medtech regulatory teams can curate eSTAR files better and faster.

Key features

1. Responsive and does not slow down with more content or attachment
In Regby, each eSTAR section self-populates without lag and does not slow down with more content or attachments—no more waiting for eSTAR to catch up to you. Directly export a submission-ready PDF file with all attachments or an XML file fully compatible with the original eSTAR PDF file.

2. Single source of truth
Changing the product name or the predicate halfway? With all the keywords—terms, standards, file names, etc.—in sync continuously, update your single source of truth once and see the change reflected throughout the eSTAR instantly.

3. Attachment file manager
Drop and drop to upload multiple files in one go. Reorder or rename files at any time. See all files in one place and sort by file size, upload timestamp or other metadata to streamline your review workflow.

4. Lock individual subsections
Lock and protect individual subsections at any time from accidental edits. Skip the error-prone and repetitive steps of copying and pasting from multiple Word files to a PDF. Submit with full confidence that every page is exactly how you like it to be.

5. Collaborative editing, commenting and change-tracking
Work on the eSTAR as team. Track progress, redline changes and comment everywhere throughout the eSTAR. Leverage the maximum synergy of your team.
